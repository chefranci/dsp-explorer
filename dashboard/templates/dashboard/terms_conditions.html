                </p>

                <h3>3. USE OF THE SERVICES</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to use the Services, the User must be 18 years of age or over and, in any case, he must have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract.

                    All the costs of connection to the internet of the device from which the User uses the Services shall be borne by the User.
                    Any request to use a Service from the User shall be binding for the Provider only if the User receives confirmation by e-mail that the request has been confirmed and the Service is available and therefore the information contained in the Resources cannot be considered as an offer to supply any Service but as an invitation to request their supply.
                    Information about the contracts entered into by the User with the Provider (technical steps, storage, access mode, detection and correction of errors, languages available, applicable terms and conditions, etc.) and about the use of the Services is available in the User Area.
                    If in the course of the order procedure, or even later on, the User finds errors, he can write to the Provider to the email address provided in the Site.
                    The contracts concluded will be stored digitally and the User will have access to his profile and contracts through the User Area and to the text of the Terms from the link available in the footer of the Site.
